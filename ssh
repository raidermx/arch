1.6.3.2. Establishing an SSH Connection
To be able to use SSH connection, create a pair of two keys consisting of a public and a private key.

1. Generate a public and a private key:
~]$ ssh-keygen
Both keys are stored in the ~/.ssh/ directory:
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub - public key
~/.ssh/id_rsa - private key
The public key does not need to be secret. It is used to verify the private key. The private
key is secret. You can choose to protect the private key with the passphrase that you
specify during the key generation process. With the passphrase, authentication is even more
secure, but is no longer password-less. You can avoid this using the ssh-agent command. In
this case, you will enter the passphrase only once - at the beginning of a session. For more
information on ssh-agent configuration, see Section 12.2.4, “Using Key-based
Authentication”.
2. Copy the most recently modified public key to a remote machine you want to log into:
~]# ssh-copy-id USER@hostname
As a result, you are now able to enter the system in a secure way, but without entering a
password.
1.6.3.3. Disabling SSH Root Login
To increase system security, you can disable SSH access for the root user, which is enabled by default.
For more information on this topic, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Security Guide .
Disabling SSH Root Login
1. Access the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:
~]# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2. Change the line that reads #PermitRootLogin yes to:
PermitRootLogin no
3. Restart the sshd service:
~]# systemctl restart sshd
